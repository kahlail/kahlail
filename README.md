- ğŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Kahlail ("kuh-lel", like Superman) and I'm a Python programmer and a self-taught musician.
- ğŸŒ± I recently completed a [Generation UK & IR](https://uk.generation.org/) programme in Data Engineering!
- ğŸ§ª I am currently developing a mini [ETL project](https://github.com/kahlail/escape_the_central_finite_curve), to help ['Eyepatch' Morty](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Evil_Morty) escape the [Central Finite Curve](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Central_Finite_Curve)!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the expansion of AI and how they are impacting live data modelling and interpretation.
- ğŸ’™ I am seeking my first role in tech!
- ğŸ“– My latest study subject: Data Structures and Algorithms.
