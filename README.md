- ğŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m @kahlail. I'm a Python programmer and a self-taught musician.
- ğŸŒ± I recently completed a Generation UK & IR programme in Data Engineering!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the expansion of AI and how this is impacting live data modelling and interpretation.
- ğŸ§ª I am currently developing a mini ETL project, with 'Eyepatch Morty' as my end client which uses the Rick and Morty API.
