- 👋 Hi there, I’m @kahlail. I'm a Python programmer and a self-taught musician.
- 🌱 I recently completed a Generation UK & IR programme in Data Engineering!
- 👀 I’m interested in the expansion of AI and how this is impacting live data modelling and interpretation.
- 🧪 I am currently developing a mini project, with a dashboard for 'Eyepatch Morty' using the Rick and Morty API.
