# 🧑🏾‍💻 I’m Kahlail - pronounced "kuh-lel" (like [superman](https://www.supermanhomepage.com/supermans-kryptonian-name-explained-kal-els-origin-and-first-use/#:~:text=On%20Krypton%2C%20his%20name%20signifies,%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9CStar%20Child%E2%80%9D.)) 
***and I'm a Python programmer and self-taught musician.***
<br/>
*Then*
```
  🌱 I recently completed a [Generation UK & IR](https://uk.generation.org/) bootcamp in partnership with [Infnity Works](https://www.infinityworks.com/) in Data Engineering -          here's the [final project](https://github.com/kahlail/generation_uk_final_project_kahlail) which I completed as part of an agile team!

  🌱 Prior to tech, I worked in hospitality as a Supervisor and Visual Merchandiser, where I gained a lot of experience in customer service and managing a team.
```

*Now*
👀 I am seeking an entry-level role in data!

```
  🌿 I've started developing a fun [mini-project](https://github.com/kahlail/escape_the_central_finite_curve),to gain experience in connecting to API's. This project uses the REST      protocol.

  🌿 I have developed a [Data Cleaning Toolkit](https://github.com/kahlail/data_tools/tree/first_tool), to help me manipulate data more efficiently (and not have to rewrite blocks      of code, over and over again).

  🌿 Check out my vizzes on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kahlail.brown.milliner/vizzes), where I have combined my engineering skills with analytical          skills.
```

*Later*

```
  🌳 I’m interested in the expansion of AI and how LLM's are impacting live data modelling, interpretation and aggregation.

  🌳 I hope to positively influence young people like me who are interested in tech.
