- 👋 Hi there, I’m @kahlail. I'm a Python programmer and a self-taught musician.
- 🌱 I recently completed a Generation UK & IR programme in Data Engineering!
- 👀 I’m interested in the expansion of AI and how this is impacting live data modelling and interpretation.
- 🧪 I am currently developing a mini ETL project, with 'Eyepatch Morty' as my end client, supporting their startegy for leaving the Central Finite Curve.
