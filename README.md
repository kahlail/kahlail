# I’m Kahlail - pronounced "kuh-lel" (like [superman](https://www.supermanhomepage.com/supermans-kryptonian-name-explained-kal-els-origin-and-first-use/#:~:text=On%20Krypton%2C%20his%20name%20signifies,%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9CStar%20Child%E2%80%9D.)) 
***and I'm a Python programmer and self-taught musician.***
<br/>
- 🌱 I recently completed a [Generation UK & IR](https://uk.generation.org/) programme in partnrship with [Infnity Works](https://www.infinityworks.com/) in Data Engineering - here's the [final project](https://github.com/kahlail/generation_uk_final_project_kahlail)!
- 🧪 Since then, I've started developing a mini [ETL project](https://github.com/kahlail/escape_the_central_finite_curve), to help ['Eyepatch' Morty](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Evil_Morty) escape the [Central Finite Curve](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Central_Finite_Curve)!
- 👀 I’m interested in the expansion of AI and how they are impacting live data modelling and interpretation.
- 💙 I am seeking my first role in tech!
- 📖 My latest study subject: Data Structures and Algorithms.
